不能只做自己分内的事儿 应该全面

I think we should be specialist but also need to know the Whole process of the E2E(end to end), which
requires us not only do the things that within our Comfort Zone but to
do whatever it takes to get our product shipped / launched.
we should have the Responsibility and Passion about what we are doing, i.e. the product that we design.

性能优化之应该在瓶颈上做, 
Performance optimization should only be done on the bottleneck, beacuse doing it on a non-bottleneck is a waste of time.

从大规模问题中找到值得解决的问题
and maybe after some years, that we also need to looking for the problems worthing to solve in many problems.
